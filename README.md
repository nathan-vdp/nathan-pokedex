# Nathan's pokedex

A pokedex made with:
- Svelte.js
- Tailwind.CSS
- CSS

## Description
This very cool project was mainly for me getting into Svelte trying to learn the syntax. I think it turned out pretty good!

This website has:
- Navbar
- Cards to display the pokemons
- When clicking on one of the cards it will go to a page where you can view the pokemon and there specific stats and what type of pokemon it is.
